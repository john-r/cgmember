<h3>Common Good&nbsp;Greenfield Awards $10K in&nbsp;Funding</h3>

<p>The Greenfield Area Common Good community has selected eight recipients to equally share $10,000 in project funding. The projects all demonstrate potential for systemic change to improve the lives of residents and the greater Greenfield community in the categories of food systems, renewable energy, small business development, social justice and the arts. "This&nbsp;is what Common Good is all about," says Ivan Ussach, Common Good's Director of Operations.&nbsp;"This first-ever round of&nbsp;funding paves the way for communities everywhere to generate financial resources to meet their own economic and social priorities."<br />&nbsp;<br />Six of the community projects were awarded a $1,250 grant and two projects were awarded a $1,250 zero-interest loan. Common Good Greenfield received more than twenty applications, and used a member-based scoring process and community meeting to make the final selections.&nbsp;Many of the projects have multiple objectives, such as saving&nbsp;the environment, addressing social justice and boosting the economy-- all crucial elements of Common Good's mission.<br />&nbsp;<br />Common Good Greenfield community organizer Emily Crehan noted, &ldquo;We received top-notch proposals from so many worthwhile initiatives. It&rsquo;s an exciting time to see the level of care in our community. We look forward to offering more funding in the coming year.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Projects</h3>

<p><strong>Co-op Power,</strong>&nbsp;will use its loan&nbsp;to install solar photovoltaic systems at the Franklin County CDC. Co-op Power&rsquo;s pilot project will provide a model that allows any non-profit to install a solar array on their building, reduce electricity costs, and reduce carbon emissions, with no money down.<br /><br /><strong>The Shea Theater</strong>&nbsp;will continue its expansive arts center revitalization project with this support from Common Good. The theater, along with its commitment to community engagement, will use the funds to complete improvements to the lobby and concession area as it continues to renovate its house sound and theatrical lighting systems.<br /><br /><strong>The Compost Cooperative</strong>&nbsp;is launching a worker-owned business which will offer composting services (including waste reduction and soil enrichment) to the Greenfield area and will create living-wage positions. Worker-owners will include former prison inmates. <br /><br /><strong>Just Roots</strong>&nbsp;will use its funding to provide five full farm shares to eligible low-income families for the 2017 season. The farm shares offer fresh, organic food from the Just Roots CSA (community-supported agriculture). Additionally, this funding will directly impact&nbsp;Just Roots' efforts with the USDA to provide&nbsp;CSA farm shares&nbsp;through national health insurance coverage.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>The Stone Soup Caf&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;will use its funds towards appliance upgrades, namely a working oven and a new freezer for its pay-what-you-can meal program. The caf&eacute; offers the only community meal available in Greenfield on weekends, and serves more than one hundred people a hot, nutritious meal from noon to two every Saturday at the All Souls Church on the corner of Hope and Main St. in Greenfield.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>The Town of Wendell</strong>&nbsp;is creating an edible forest garden, which will provide education about local growing conditions and plants as well as edible produce, right on town-owned land. Once established, the garden&nbsp;will serve as plant stock/ seed stock for town residents to start their own gardens. Surplus food will be donated to the town's food pantry.<br /> <br /><strong>The Art Garden</strong>&nbsp;is holding four inter-generational "Art as Service" workshops to create community-service art projects. Participants will determine community needs and may create art for senior centers or community meals, or&nbsp;for families in transition through NELCWIT, or projects in appreciation for teachers, town employees or emergency responders.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><strong>The Ashfield Lake House</strong>&nbsp;also received a loan for its solar project. The solar installation will supply the restaurant, offices, and overall building with one-third of its current total average monthly electrical consumption. The Ashfield Lake House is committed to supplying a significant amount of the building's energy from a non-polluting on-site source.</p>
