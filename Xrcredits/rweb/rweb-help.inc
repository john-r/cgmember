    <p>%RCREDITS are a type of credit. Like any medium of exchange, they represent value. They make it possible for us to trade goods and services with each other in our community, without having to trade something directly with whoever has what we want, and without having to give them something of precisely the same value ("barter"). The medium of exchange lets us give any amount of our goods or services to any participant in the economy, then receive the same value of goods or services from some other participant(s). If everyone both buys and sells, the credits move through the community in interconnected circles of exchange.</p>
    <p>Issuing %RCREDITS is a community responsibility. This is the key to creating a %PROJECT Economy. We must issue as much credit as we need, to enable our exchanges of goods and services -- but no more than the value we as a community are capable of producing.</p>
    <p>Once %RCREDITS become well-established and popular in a community, we can issue them together, with careful planning, as grants, zero-interest loans, equity investments, and incentives for doing the right thing. Together we can fund whatever enterprises and activities we decide would be best -- for our community, for communities elsewhere, and for the world.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, until then, %RCREDITS are issued automatically:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>as a stand-in for US Dollars, which are held unused in a separate account, and</li>
      <li>as an increase in your credit line (or in some %PROJECT communities &mdash; as tentative incentive rewards*) to encourage doing what makes the system stronger.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>* Any incentive rewards you receive (signup bonuses, purchase rewards, inviter/helper rewards, and inflation offset) are yours to keep once your %PROJECT community says so. Meanwhile you can borrow them interest-free.</p>

    <p>Your %PROJECT Community must take care to keep enough money in the Community US Dollar Pool to cover requests by members to <%aCashout>move funds to their bank account</a>, trading some of their %RCREDITS for US Dollars.</p>
    
    <p>If you misjudge and use too much of the Community's US Dollar Pool, you will have a short-term cash flow challenge until more US Dollars come in. The "<%aBack>backing</a>" clause in the %PROJECT Agreement provides stability, so your %PROJECT Community can handle such challenges smoothly.</p>

When someone pays you in %RCREDITS, you can spend those funds &mdash; OR you can "cash them out" by transferring them to your bank account or exchanging them for US Dollars.</p>
    <p>You can cash out %RCREDITS that someone <i>pays</i> you, but any %RCREDITS you borrow, using your credit line, must continue to circulate within the %PROJECT system. You cannot cash them out &mdash; you can only spend them.</p>

/*  if ($i == 'credit-reserve') return t(<<<X
    <p><b>Background.</b> It is crucial to the success of the %PROJECT system that most members maintain a positive account balance, so there are some %RCREDITS to circulate in the community. While the system is small, it is a bit frail in that regard, so we need to be extra careful to make sure there is no "<%aCrunch>cash flow crunch</a>" at least until we are ready to handle it as a strong, well-functioning democratic %PROJECT community.</p>

    <p><b>Your Credit Reserve.</b> So we divide your account into two pieces: your Balance and your Credit Reserve. Your incentive rewards go into the Credit Reserve, to encourage you to keep them in the system until you need them. This is like a traditional reserve credit line that kicks in whenever you would otherwise overdraw your checking account &mdash; except there are no fees here. You can spend those reserved funds any time, simply by letting your Balance go negative.</p>

    <p>For example, if you have $300 in your account and $100 of that is incentive rewards that you received (free), then your balance will show as $200, with a Credit Reserve of $100.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, we issue %RCREDITS together as a commmunity, so it is up to all of us to protect their value. Most people choose to keep a positive Balance, by setting a Target Balance on the Preferences settings page. Keeping most of the %RCREDITS we issue in the system helps the system stay healthy while it grows more and more robust.</p>

  if ($i == 'closing-down') return t(<<<X
     <p>%PROJECT staff and advisers have put great care into designing the %PROJECT System so that it will continue to flourish. In the unlikely event your %PROJECT Community or the %PROJECT System needs to close down, the %PROJECT Agreement gives us a way to end gracefully.</p>
     <p>As part of the %PROJECT Agreement, you promise to bring your balance up to zero if it is negative. You can either:</p>
     <ul><li>continue to accept %RCREDITS until you are square OR</li>
         <li>trade US Dollars to another member in exchange for %RCREDITS OR</li>
         <li>transfer US Dollars from your bank account.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Complementarily, if the system ends and you have a positive balance, you can:</p>
     <ul><li>continue to make purchases with your credits for a limited time OR</li>
         <li>trade them to another member in exchange for US Dollars OR</li>
         <li>transfer them to your bank account.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>We all make this agreement so if the system closes down, everyone is protected.</p>
		 <p>However, if you and your %PROJECT Community have made mistakes in handling the Community's Dollar Pool and you need to close down when there are no longer enough Dollars in the Pool to redeem the %RCREDITS in circulation, the value of everyone's %RCREDITS will be proportionately diminished, as you are settlings the accounts and closing down.</p>

/*  if ($i == 'ready') return t(<<<X
     <p>There is no magic formula (yet) for deciding when a %PROJECT Community is ready to allow cashing out incentive rewards. The important question is: who gets to decide such things?</p>
     <p>The %PROJECT system was invented for a single, critically important purpose: to create an opportunity for the community to take responsibility for its own economy. In a <%aCGC>%PROJECT Community</a> you decide, along with your friends and neighbors, how many %RCREDITS to issue as incentive rewards, and how many as grants, loans, and investments. You decide what to incentivize:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>buying local?</li>
       <li>eating organic food?</li>
       <li>using renewable energy sources?</li>
       <li>creating works of art?</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Being able to discuss and decide together what to incentivize and what to fund means we decide together what to make happen in our world. The future is ours. Together we can provide a decent life for everyone in our community, offer a hand to people elsewhere, and do our part to rescue ourselves from the brink of climate-change disaster.</p>
     <p>Having enough throughput to be able to issue incentive rewards is a small step along that path. Nobody knows yet when we will have a fully-functioning %PROJECT Community, capable of making that judgment. One of our community organizers predicts it will be when there are about 3,000 %PROJECT members. Time will tell.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, you are encouraged to maintain a positive account balance, treating your incentive rewards (if any) as a <%aReserve>Credit Reserve</a>, so those %RCREDITS can keep circulating among the participants as much as possible, while we grow.</p>

    <p>We can keep issuing %RCREDITS (in exchange for Dollars or as negative account balances) as long as there is a net inflow of US Dollars (more <b class="in">green</b> than <b class="out">orange</b> on the chart &mdash; an increasing demand). If members need to make more purchases outside the %PROJECT network and are taking more US Dollars <b class="out">out</b> of the system than they are putting <b class="in">in</b> (a decreasing demand), then we must temporarily slow down <i>issuing</i> %RCREDITS. So when the community's demand is negative three months in a row, the system automatically alerts the %PROJECT Community's administrators, who can put a temporary ban on spending below a zero balance.</p>
    <p>Transfers from a %PROJECT Account to a bank account often reflect an incomplete <%aCircles>economic circle</a>. That is, the individual or company moving %RCREDITS to a bank account does not yet have enough places to spend them. Generally, this means they are spending them outside the community (and outside the %PROJECT system). This is an opportunity for import-replacement &mdash; starting new local businesses (or expanding existing businesses) to supply goods or services not currently produced in our region.</p>
    <p>How low our total monthly volume of outward transfers is, is a measure of how well we are doing as a community in our progress toward a sustainable local economy.</p>
    <p>As an individual, you can help by finding ways to spend within the %PROJECT system, instead of transferring your funds to a bank account. For all the money that circulates within the system, we can use %RCREDITS, freeing up that many US Dollars to use for something else. So, in effect, when you can keep money in the system, we are all that much richer.</p>

  if ($i == 'dollar-pool') return w\chartFrame('funds') . t(<<<X
    <p>There are two kinds of funds in the %PROJECT system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="cgcredits">%RCREDITS</b>. These are the funds we issue together as a community, by agreeing to accept them as payment for our goods and services (or labor). We issue %RCREDITS in two ways: (1) in exchange for US Dollars AND (2) by allowing member accounts to have a negative balance. The orange area shows the total negative balances. The amount of %RCREDITS is exactly equal to the Dollar Pool amount (blue line) plus the amount of negative balances.</li>
      <li><p><b class="usd">US Dollars</b>. When you transfer funds from bank account to your %PROJECT Account, that money goes into the %PROJECT Community Fund Dollar Pool &mdash; a bank account owned by the community. You get an equal amount of %RCREDITS to use instead, to buy something from a participating business.</p>
      
      <p>The business can then use those %RCREDITS to pay its employees and suppliers, those suppliers pay their employees and suppliers, then all those employees become customers again and use those same %RCREDITS to buy things again from participating businesses. The credits go around and around.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Dollars you put in have <i>not</i> been used for purchases, so as participation grows the Dollar Pool accumulates more and more US Dollars, waiting to be used. From time to time when someone can't easily spend all their credits within the %PROJECT System, they trade some back in for US Dollars from the US Dollar Pool. So the amount in the Dollar Pool goes up and down a little as it grows.</p>
      
      <p>Once we have enough active participation, we can decide together, as a community, how best to use the Dollar Pool funds &mdash; for strategic incentives, grants, zero-interest loans, and equity investments for sustainability and the common good.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The chart also shows several measures to help you manage your community's %PROJECT economy without putting it in danger of a <%aCrunch>cash flow crunch</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b class="savings">Savings</b>. This line shows how much of the money in circulation is not actually being used each month for purchases. Money in use tends to stay in the system, whereas participants are more likely to cash out any extra money in their accounts beyond what they use regularly for purchases.</li>
      <li><b class="top3">Top 3(%)</b>. For accounts with the highest balance (the top 3 or top 3%, whichever is higher), those balances are totaled and shown as a red line. It is unlikely that 3% of the account-holders would decide all at once to spend (or cash out) their entire balance.</li>
      <li><b class="top3">Bottom 3(%)</b>. The accounts with the lowest balances are also shown with a red line. Encourage members to bring these balances up to zero or more, to increase the size of the community's Dollar Pool (blue line).</li>
      <li><b class="neg">Negative Balances</b>. The orange area shows the total of all negative balances. This is money borrowed by members and participating businesses, that would otherwise be in the Dollar Pool. Every time you spend money you don't have (resulting in a negative balance), you are <i>creating money</i>. As a community, we have a limit to how much money we can create. When your balance goes negative, we have that much less ability as a community to fund the common good. So the system encourages you to use your credit line only as a temporary convenience, bringing it back above zero as soon as possible.</li>
      <li><b class="limit">Credit Limits</b>. Each account has a credit line, equal to its average monthly activity over the past 6 months. For example, if your credit limit is $100, your account balance is allowed to go as low as negative $100 and no lower*. The pink line totals those credit limits for all accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* Your balance is not allowed to go below zero unless you choose that setting in your Preferences (on the Settings menu).</p>

    <p>In our society at large, how fast the money moves is an indicator of the health of our economy. Faster velocity implies more people spending more money per month.</p>
    <p>More spending is not necessarily a good thing, if we all already have what we need. But when there are unmet needs, increased economic activity can be a sign of things getting better. In the %PROJECT system, economic activity means people are finding the %PROJECT system useful, which is always a good thing.</p>
    <p>Notice that the faster money circulates, the less money we need, to buy the same stuff. Velocity is a money-stretcher! For example, suppose there are $1 million worth of %RCREDITS in circulation. Let's say the velocity is 1 in April (the whole million gets spent) and 2 in May (the whole million gets spent twice). In May we used the same amount of money to buy twice as much.</p>
    <p>For comparison, the velocity of M2 money stock in the United States over the past half century has fluctuated between .25 and .45 per month (as you can see on the chart, %RCREDITS circulation velocity is quite a bit higher).
    <p>The <b class="local">local</b> and <b class="inter">inter-community</b> rates are shown separately. When either rate is high, it reflects healthy trade (within the community or between %PROJECT Communities).</p>
    <p>The Dollar <b class="usd">exchange</b> velocity is also shown (blue line), to reflect opportunities for import-replacement &mdash; buying things within the %PROJECT System that currently are being bought elsewhere.</p>

  if ($i == 'economic-circles' or $i == 'transaction-volume') return w\chartFrame('volume') . t(<<<X
    <p>Economic circles are crucial to a healthy regional economy. The more we can keep money circulating locally, the richer we are. Why? Because we can use that money over and over &mdash; in effect turning each dollar into millions.</p>
    <p>In a typical economic circle, you buy something from a local store or pay for local services. That business then pays its local suppliers and its local employees. Those employees in turn become consumers like you &mdash; they buy something from a local store, etc. When at any point in this circle we lose the "local" and pay someone or some company outside our region, that money is gone. It has leaked out of our community and we are that much poorer.</p>
    <p>The %PROJECT system gives us an easy way to track our economic circles and opportunities for improvement.</p>
    <p>This chart shows four types of transactions. For strong economic circles, we should see the volume of person-to-business (<b class='p2b'>p2b</b>) transactions matching the volume of business-to-person (<b class='b2p'>b2p</b>) transactions. More <b class='p2b'>p2b</b> than <b class='b2p'>b2p</b> means business are not paying enough local employees (or other local businesses). More <b class='b2p'>b2p</b> than <b class='p2b'>p2b</b> means people are shopping elsewhere. As you see (in red), several member businesses have begun paying their employees in %RCREDITS (see our <%aFB>FaceBook post</a> on how we solved the payroll challenge).</p>
    <p>The <%aDemand>Monthly Bank Transfers</a> chart also measures how well we are doing as a community, at keeping money in the system.</p>

By using %RCREDITS in place of those funds, as they circulate among %PROJECT members, we can free up that much US Dollars for the community to grant, lend, or invest.</li>
      <li><b>Rewards.</b> The amount of your incentive rewards for buying and selling (if your %PROJECT community offers incentive rewards) &mdash; reflecting the explicit value the community places on your using %RCREDITS for purchases and sales.</li>
      <li><b>Community funding.</b> Your per-capita share of the funds the community has already granted, loaned, or invested. The continued viability of that funding is supported by your participation. (counted as part of social benefits ever, but not in the past month)</li>
      <li><b>Card fees saved.</b> A percentage (%R_CC_RATE%) of your purchase and sale amounts &mdash; the typical processing fee that businesses pay for credit card purchases. Together with the other party to the transaction, you kept that much money from leaking out of the community to the big banks.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Control.</b> Of course your participation benefits the community far beyond mere money. The commmunity benefits by all of us together having greater control over our local economy, so we can plan and decide together how to use the power of money to make a better life for everyone.</p>
