Feature: Exchange
AS a member
I WANT to trade rCredits for another member's USD or exchange of US Dollars or other currency
SO I can buy stuff I can't buy with rCredits.

OR I WANT to trade exchange of US Dollars or other currency for another member's rCredits
SO I can buy more with rCredits and get incentive rewards.
