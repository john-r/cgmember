Feature: Preferences
AS a member
I WANT to set certain preferences
SO I can automate and control the behavior of my rCredits account.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | id   | crumbs | minimum | savingsAdd | saveWeekly | achMin | floor | flags   |*
  | .ZZA |    .01 |     100 |          0 |          1 |     20 |    10 | ok,confirmed,nosearch,paper |
  | .ZZB |    .02 |     -10 |         10 |          0 |     50 |     0 | ok,confirmed,weekly,secret |
  And transactions: 
  | xid | created   | type   | amount | from | to   | purpose | taking |*
  |   1 | %today-6m | signup |    250 | ctty | .ZZA | signup  | 0      |
  |   2 | %today-6m | signup |    250 | ctty | .ZZB | signup  | 0      |
  
Scenario: A member visits the preferences page
  When member ".ZZA" visits page "settings/preferences"
  Then we show "Account Preferences" with:

  And radio "statements" is "printed statements"
  And radio "notices" is "daily"
  And we show checked:
  | No Search | by name or account ID only |
  And we show unchecked:
  | Secret Balance | Don't let merchants |

Scenario: Another member visits the preferences page
  When member ".ZZB" visits page "settings/preferences"
  Then we show "Account Preferences" with:
  | Crumbs | 2 |
  And radio "statements" is "accept electronic"
  And radio "notices" is "weekly"
  And we show checked:
  | Secret Balance | Don't let merchants |
  And we show unchecked:
  | No Search | by name or account ID only |
