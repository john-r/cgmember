Feature: Joint
AS a member
I WANT to join my rCredits account to someone else's
SO we can share our finances, as for a typical "joint account" at a bank.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | id   | fullName   | acctType    | flags                     | rebate | minimum | created   |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One    | personal    | ok,confirmed,ided         |     10 |     100 | %today-6m |

  When member ".ZZA" completes relations form with values:

  Then members have:
  | id   | jid  | minimum |*
  | .ZZA | .ZZB |     150 |
  | .ZZB | .ZZA |       0 |
  And member ".ZZA" cache is ok
  And member ".ZZB" cache is ok
  # cache is ok tests acct::cacheOk, to make sure cron doesn't muck with the cached amounts
  
  When member ".ZZA" confirms form "pay" with values:
  | op  | who        | amount | goods      | purpose |*
  | pay | Corner Pub |     20 | %FOR_GOODS | stuff   |

  | op  | who        | amount | goods      | purpose |*
  | pay | Corner Pub |    300 | %FOR_GOODS | crud    |
  Then member ".ZZA" cache is ok
  And member ".ZZB" cache is ok
  Then member ".ZZA" cache is ok
  And member ".ZZB" cache is ok
  # do it twice, to make sure cacheOk() doesn't screw it up
