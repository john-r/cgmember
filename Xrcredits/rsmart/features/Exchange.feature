Feature: Exchange
AS a company agent
I WANT to transfer rCredits to or from another member in exchange for cash
SO my company can accept cash deposits and give customers cash.

# We will eventually need variants or separate feature files for neighbor (member of different community within the region) to member, etc. and foreigner (member on a different server) to member, etc.
# cc means cardCode
# while testing, bonus is artificially set at twice the rebate amount
