rCredits Software
To Do (see the G Suite spreadsheet instead)

Software Priorities:
1. App (in process)
2. Ease of signup, etc.
3. Dump Drupal
4. Biodiesel Pump
5. Server efficiency
6. Greater Security (and security audit)

NON_SOFTWARE TO_DOs
- pay $400 to apply to returnpath.com to be listed as a trusted email sender (so Outlook/hotmail/live.com users can receive our emails)?
- create rc2.me on rcredits.org WHM, add pointers on myhosting.com as for rc4.me, copy rc4.me's .htaccess (modified), and change ServerAlias www.rc2.me to *.rc2.me

- Fuzzy: what's up with Stacey Matlen (248 763 1903)? Bad email, no rCard use. 
- What's up Janice Sorenson 26742000000180 (bad email?)
- survey Fosters employees: 5 checkboxes and one blank (where shop?): Gfld Games? The Barn? Foster's? Other mkt?
- DONE contact Lorien Pratt (recommended by Barry) This is Lorien's pitch on Decision Analysis:     
  . http://www.lorienpratt.com/how-can-i-help-you/decision-intelligence-analysis-modeling-training-and-systems/
- send Business Name Change requests for rCredits Western Mass Region to IRS-Stop 343G, Cincinnati, OH 45999.
- short tagline (see Richard Tillberg's ideas), like "rCredits, the Money Co-op"
- ask Steve Alves to make a movie about rCredits
- form publicity committee (as decided by the board)
- rCredits gift card (essentially an invitation from another member, but with a printed $50 value (if you use this card for purchases at GFM, Foster's, or the Barn)
- Use BeenVerified.com routinely
- Get a security audit
- Offer new businesses guaranteed bonus (hundreds or thousands) for signing up and trying it. "We're so sure it will benefit you, we will write you a check for $4,000 to give it a try."
- FAQs for promo site (under Why rCredits)
- "rCredits Accepted Here" register stickers (4x2")
- (from mike morton) after we grow, might be nice to do newsletter features on:
        • the person who’s successfully directly invited the most other people
        • ditto, but directly-and-indirectly combined, sort of “most descendants”
        • the longest chain of successful invites (probably not that long, so maybe more than one chain)
- Once we have an office: apply to the MA Executive Office of Health and Human Services Dept. of Transitional Assistance for Community Service Volunteers (on site). Also Catholic Charities.

TASKS FOR NEXT UPDATE:
. REBUILD menus

SECURITY AND RELIABILITY TASKS to do whenever:
.  We will also want a way to cope with internet outages (local or national). (David this paragraph is mostly for you, after the next sentence.) The current plan is to develop a mobile app that saves a working copy of the entire system in a distributed network (of smart devices) with lots of redundancy. For example, we want each merchant's device(s) to recognize their repeat customers. Each new customer who pays with a smart device (rather than a card) (which we will encourage at some point, perhaps by giving people an extra $5 if they forgo the card, or an extra penny per transaction) brings data to the merchant:
  - some encrypted gem that gets passed from member to member on each transaction, to prove their identity and/or balance and/or connection to the merchant's community
  - miscellaneous (encrypted) transaction data to add to the merchant's records. (This might just be a second purpose for the same data.)
  - In such times, even participants without a smart device could be given a paper receipt that is a single large QR code, to carry to their next transaction. Better, they could be given a (re-writable) mag-stripe card (or the equivalent) that the next merchant reads and re-writes.

. (2013-02-13) i had a dream last night that peace prevailed among the human planets because a benign alien race provided a way to verify the identity of any speaker. This morning the following ideas came to me, about how to approach that ideal. Members should be able to choose their security method:
  . whenever the transaction is between accounts from different regions, in-person merchant must ask the customer for a "travel word". The system reports a new travel word (for next time) that the merchant then tells the customer.
  . the foreign in-person merchant can ask for a PIN (that doesn't change)
  . the customer must show a separate photo ID
  . the customer must pay with an ad-hoc smartphone QR, rather than a card (best). The QR is valid for only 2 minutes (and only once).
  . either in-person or online, the customer must verify the purchase by text message or email (within 2 minutes or so)
  . online, no extra security for requests from the usual machine/IP/cookie. Otherwise customer must first go to the rcredits website separately and log in (you can create an icon, to make this easy).
  . different options may apply for different charge amounts. Rate the "level" of each method and suggest appropriate levels/defaults for (rounded) price ranges (0-5, 6-25, 26-100, 101-500, 501-2500, 2501+)
  . "Protect yourself from identity theft: (give standard tips, plus:) As long as you are using rCredits on *this machine*, we will not need to ask you any security questions. Do not sign in to rCredits on a machine you don't trust. If you must, then as soon as you get home, check your transaction history and change your password and security questions. If you are shopping online at a non-local site, when it comes time to pay, make sure you are really on the rCredits site (show what to look for).
  . (when the member buys something online from a foreign site, from an unusual machine, ALWAYS require confirmation by email. Do not show settings except from home machine)
  
. security later: 
  . Make the agent's picture appear from behind the "r", get big, then shrink and settle into place, traveling in the shape of an "r", ideally leaving a jet trail.
  . How to prove the logged-out site is rcredits? Maybe always ask first "It looks like you came here from an rCredits member site. Make sure this is the real rCredits website! Does your url bar say https://new.rcredits.org? Does it show a security symbol? We will display this reminder only once in a while. Don't let the identity thieves get you. Be sure to check the url bar <i>every time</i>."
@todo: add videos, like this:
  <video width="320" height="240" controls autoplay>
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag. (maybe embed a clickable vid in an iframe here?)
  </video>
@todo: rate each account health as ratio of total demand of repeat payees (2x/2.5mos) to total demand of recent payers (2.5mos) (potential for future) OR to monthly sales (current health); also rate of change of sales volume (maximize for everyone and not negative)

/**

}

@todo: move some util functions, like ray(), to rcredits-basic.inc and "USE" them everywhere without a namespace qualifier.
@todo: allow surrounding spaces on all web input, leading dollar signs in amounts. Test. (mostly done)
@todo: we also need some kind of confirmation on foreign transactions (from the other server)
@todo: store city code (rather than city), with a code for "other" -- store other in data or r_other (same for country/state) MAYBE
@todo: reporting for a community or server (a form that anyone can use)
@todo: download transactions in other standard formats
@todo: Finish separating backend. Front end should have no registered users.
@todo: use popups for some things
@todo: make help divs draggable
@todo: option to suppress current balance in messages (make it a separate message) B_SHOWBAL (default TRUE)
@todo: Miscellaneous other data to collect:
  Names and Social Security Numbers of Dependents [and answer: why do we need this?]
@todo: closed accounts have only read perm and point (data[new_account]) at new account qid
@todo: servers exchange info on which ss#s (or other ids) are dups
@todo
. remove all direct db operations from interface modules (and their .inc files) -- use be\ and u\ there, but not r\
