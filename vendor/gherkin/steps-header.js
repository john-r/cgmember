 * Methods within the %MMODULE_steps object function are not indented -- do not change that!
 * The last character in this file must be the object function's closing brace (}).
 *
 * Be assured that no functions will be deleted and the compiler will
 * not alter code within a function unless you make it look like a function header.
 *
 * You may also add statements just below this header.
